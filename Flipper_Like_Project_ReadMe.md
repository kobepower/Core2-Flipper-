# Flipper-Like Project with M5Stack Core2

Welcome to the **Flipper-Like Project using M5Stack Core2**! This project aims to transform the M5Stack Core2 into a versatile, Flipper Zero-like device. By leveraging the Core2's hardware capabilities and expanding its functionality with additional modules and custom software, we hope to build a powerful tool for RF communication, signal analysis, and more.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to create a device inspired by the **Flipper Zero**, but based on the open-source-friendly **M5Stack Core2** hardware. This project will focus on:

- **RF communication**: Support for common protocols like Sub-1GHz, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LoRa.
- **Modularity**: Integration with M5Stack modules (e.g., LoRa, RS485, Proto Boards).
- **User Interface**: A touchscreen interface powered by the Core2's built-in display.
- **Expandability**: Allow for additional custom hardware, such as CC1101, NRF24L01, and FPGA modules.
- **Open Development**: Create a community-driven project where developers can contribute new features and improve existing ones.

## **Current Features**

- **Hardware Integration**:
  - M5Stack Core2 touchscreen and processing power.
  - RF modules: CC1101, LoRa (433MHz and 900MHz), and NRF24L01.
  - Support for additional modules: FPGA (iCESugar-nano), ESP32, and external antennas.

- **Planned Functionalities**:
  - Sub-1GHz scanning and transmission.
  - Signal replay and analysis.
  - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication.
  - Infrared (IR) support.
  - GPIO-based hacking tools.
